# SlideshowExampleForReddit

This is an example slideshow that I made a while ago and modified for a Reddit post.

It may not seem like it, but `slideshow.pdf` is the actual slideshow and that's the only file you need.  There are instructions in the document itself, but all you need to do is download it and open it in your browser.
